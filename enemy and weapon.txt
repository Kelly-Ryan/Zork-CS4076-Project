weapon and enemy overloaded +
health - damage
if damage <= 0 
alive = false
emit signal defeated
slot for signal defeted deletes enemy obj
enemy and weapon are friends

do item and inventory even need to be friends anymore

the useItem fn where do they come in
have an attack button in player


player has a var GameItem - this is what the user currently has in their hand
signals and slot to set this gameitem in hand
collision between player and enemy and if the gameitem is a weapon take damage
but need the attack button

could get in dynamic cast somewhere here perhaps
