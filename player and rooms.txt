player has a room - avoids need for global var
update this room var
on change room could emit a signal - can pass room in the signal then the slot in game can just be a setScene() that takes a room
as for the player could possibly pass coords in the signal too and the slot then would use this to do a setPos for player but in the game class
singal would be in player but slot is in game
make a connection between player and this(ie game) within the game class

room is passed in constructor that way can "update" when reposition when change room
if needed could have a getExits in room might make the search easier idk
