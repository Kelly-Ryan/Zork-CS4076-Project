NB !!!! - tomorrow
double click in inventory that is then set as item in hand - makes sense for key and weapon
if double click and if potion then increase the lives by that amt just do a check to see if of type potion
will need to add a check to see if collide with potion and if lives not full then directly apply potion
else ask if want to add to inventory

-> need health potion and key to be their own classes rather than as a general item class


itemInfo for key says single use for health potion says # lives extra it gives

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

player or enemy reaches 0 lives have hiding for now
enemy is deleted
but for player want game to end
could disconnect the enemy and have popup or have a game over scene
for now just debug message saying game over

General things to fix
how many enemies per room - if multiple have to edit the setPos in enemy
check enemy movement with kelly - sometimes it goes off screen to right and spawns out of room
inventory can close and also move it - dont want this behaviour
-> think there is a signal for close button override this
add an array somewhere
pass by value somewhere to use the copy constructor
do want to restrict lives to a certain level - for eg if add lives and it would give more than # start with
