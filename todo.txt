need to refocus after click on inventory
ok otherwise

need to set the item player is holding
also how gonna use the items from the list

need to fix enemy movement - keep the enemy to within the room NB

do we need an inventory weight listed somewhere
be able to delete from inventory perhaps
probs makes sense if player collides with item and then ask if want to collect it
